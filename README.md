# Child Immunization System
This project was developed by collaborating with my classmates.
According to research, in India more than millions of children remain unimmunized every year due to poor healthcare services. This project was developed with the aim to provide quality healthcare assistance and to have a strict communication between doctors, patients & patients parents. It took us around 2 months to develop the project.
